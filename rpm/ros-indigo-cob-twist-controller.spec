%description
The main purpose of the cob_twist_controller is to convert target twists into
joint velocities. Therefore it makes use of several implemented inverse
kinematics approaches at the first order differential level. The inverse
differential kinematics solver considers kinematic chain extensions, singularity
robustness, redundancy resolution and priority-based methods. To avoid hardware
destruction there is a limiter interface active as well. Via parameter server
users can dynamically configure the solving strategy.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
